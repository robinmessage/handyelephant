= Migration SQL Generator

This is a Rails plugin to generate SQL from migrations.  

It achieves this by monkey patching the definitions of ActiveRecord::Base.connection.execute and other  related methods.

It has only been tested with the sqlserver and mysql adapters (see limitations).  If you test it with another adapter and it works, please let me know!

== Installation

script/plugin install git://github.com/muness/migration_sql_generator.git

== Usage

rake db:generate:migration_sql

== Known limits

* May fail on migrations that perform CRUD via ActiveRecord methods
* With the mysql adapter, fails on change_column, rename_column
* Fails on redhillonrails_core plugin with the mysql adapter
